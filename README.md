Flipster

Flipster is based on the classic game of memory with a social media twist. A player logs in with Instagram and starts a new game. Then waits for an opponent to challenge your memory using both players photos from Instagram. This application is built 100% in JavaScript using Sails. Sails is a light weight framework built with Node.js and Express.js. While the goal was to utilize the real time WebSockets built into Sails many other features became useful during the process.
